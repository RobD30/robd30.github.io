# Intro

This is my take on the Neighborhood Map project from the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree.

### Run

This is a batteries included, ES6 compliant JavaScript app that shows you around some of the
best local "secret" places. Follow these simple steps to enjoy some of Reno's Secret places.
1. Run on ```localhost:8080```
    * In your terminal create a local server ```python -m http.server 8080```
    * Run the open the ```index.html``` on the local server
2. For even easier use simple go to robd30.github.io  to enjoy a live version of the app.

### Some Suggestions

In this part I will recommend some of the great things that they have at some of the places.

1. Donut Bistro
    * I personally love to get the Apple Fritter here. If you get there when they have just come out its amazing.
2. Water Springs Diner & Bar
    * Despite its name this place is actually a really good Mexican Restaurant and I would say they have the best
    Shrimp Cocktail I have ever had. It is a traditional Mexican Shrimp Cocktail.
3. Super Burrito
    * My recommendation is in the name itself, Super Burrito. You can ask for it wet with an amazing sauce.
4. Panaderia Azteca Mexico
    * This place isn't a restaurant but instead you can get delicious Tamales. I recommend the Pork or Cheese Tamales.
5. Sui Korean BBQ
    * A good Korean BBQ place with many interesting choices.
    * They do serve Tsing Tao Beer.
6. Sawasdee Thai
    * They have very good Pad Thai as well as Stuffed Chicken Wings. 
    * They also server Tsing Tao Beer.
7. Bazaar European Deli and Cafe
    * They serve a Smoked Salmon Sandwich that is really amazing.
    * **WARNING** I am fairly certain that the proprietor of this establishment is either ex KGB or a member of the Red Mob... or both.
8. Soochow
    * Try the Crispy Fried Eggplant, you wont be disappointed
    * They also serve Tsing Tao Beer
9. Jack's Cafe
    * This is a real local treat. They are only open for Breakfast and Lunch
    * They have a dish with Biscuits and Grave that is called "The Manhandler"
    * They have an excellent Chorizo and Eggs that is almost as good as my Grandmothers.
10. Port of Subs
    * I know this is a Franchise place but... This one is the best one in town.
    * The staff are super friendly and their food is always really fresh.
    * For an added treat, try one of their Brownies.
11. Lighthouse Coffee
    * Finally because everyone needs a good cup of coffee this place is the best in town.
    * My favorite would be the Caramilla with an extra shot of espresso.
    * They also have smoothies.
    * They have more locations throughout town.
